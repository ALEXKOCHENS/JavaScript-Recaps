## Loops

This is a control structure/way that allows to do iterations until a certain condition is met, ot not

for([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression];[incrementExpression]){
//Statement.
}

initialExpression---This initializes a variable or a counter

conditionExpression---This defines the condition that the loop will continue to run as log as its met, and stops the loop if the condition is false

incrementExpression---This usually increments the variable. Its the expression that will be executed for each iteration of the loop

Statement---This is the code that will be executed each time the loop is run.
